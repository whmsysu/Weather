# Weather
----
###Version 1.0.0
This is a demo project to understand React and Redux. Weather website displays forecast for specific city in US. You can check cities in the U.S. when you type in. It will be auto-completed in search bar.  


As we put keys in gitignore, you have to apply a google map key. And then create a dev.js and prod.js under '/src/config' and put keys into it like following.

module.exports = {
  GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY: 'xxxxxxxx',
  OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY: 'xxxxxxxx'
}
